      <h1 class="platform--heading">Simplicity</h1>
      <h3 class="platform--explainer">From the moment someone sets up InfluxDB to the moment their time series data begins appearing, the magic of our product is that it is drop-dead simple. Everything we do and everything we say should reflect our commitment to making things as simple as possible.</h3>
      <h3 class="platform--explainer">We have tried to embrace passion in our visual identity and writing style – the website is flatter, the navigation simplified, the images simplified; everything more simple and consistent. This is a journey but we want to ensure we embrace this passion in every interaction we have with our audiences – website, email copy and product.</h3>

      <h1 class="platform--heading">Data is best understood<br/>through the lens of time</h1>
      <h3 class="platform--explainer">We will not be making billboards about this vision! It is more a statement about what we think the future state will be. This transcends a version of the product and the stage of where we are as a company now. This is what propels us to build products and solutions that help achieve this vision.</h3>
      <h3 class="platform--explainer">If you read <a href="http://www.influxdata.com/about" target="_blank">the about page</a>, you will see how we have incorporated this into some of our core messaging but we will not be leading with vision; rather, we will focus on our mission.</h3>

      <description>Brand Platform       Core Passion  Simplicity From the moment someone sets up InfluxDB to the moment their time series data begins appearing, the magic of our product is that it is drop-dead simple. Everything we do and everything we say should reflect our commitment to making things as simple as possible. We have tried to embrace passion in our visual identity and writing style â€“ the website is flatter, the navigation simplified, the images simplified; everything more simple and consistent.</description>
